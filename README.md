# memory-game-app

- The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

- The application tracks the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
