Application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events. The app tracks the user's score, which increments by 1 when an image is cliked for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
